# üè® Hotel Revenue Analysis (SQL-Based)

This project presents a comprehensive **SQL-based analysis** of hotel booking data, focusing on revenue trends, customer behaviors, room preferences, and booking patterns across multiple years.

## üéØ Objectives

To answer key business questions that affect hotel revenue and operations using raw SQL queries on structured hotel booking data.


## üîç Business Questions Answered

1. üìà **What is the profit percentage for each month across all years?**

2. üçΩÔ∏è **Which meals and market segments (e.g., families, corporate clients, etc.) contribute the most to the total revenue for each hotel annually?**

3. üèñÔ∏è **How does revenue compare between public holidays and regular days each year?**

4. üß© **What are the key factors (e.g., hotel type, market type, meals, nights booked) that significantly impact hotel revenue annually?**
  
5. üõèÔ∏è **Based on stay data, what are the yearly trends in customer preferences for room types (e.g., family rooms vs. single rooms), and how do these preferences influence revenue?**

6. üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß **What is the annual count of adults, children, and babies in the bookings?**

7. üîç **What is the annual percentage of bookings by reservation status?**

8. üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß **What is the annual ratio of individual bookings (adults only) versus family bookings (with children or babies)?**

9. üîÅ **What is the annual percentage of cases where the reserved room matches the assigned room?**

10. üí° **What is the annual percentage of repeated guests compared to non-repeated guests?**

 ## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
 
- **Microsoft SQL Server** ‚Äì for querying and analysis
- **CSV** ‚Äì for exporting results


 ## üßæ Tables & Key Columns Used

- `arrival_date_day_of_month`
- `stays_in_week_nights`
- `stays_in_weekend_nights`
- `reserved_room_type`
- `assigned_room_type`
- `adr` (Average Daily Rate)
- `is_repeated_guest`
- `adults`
- `children`
- `babies`
- `meal`
- `country`
- `market segment`
- `distripution channel`
- `previous cancellation`
- `previous_bookings_not_canceled`
- `booking_changes`
- `deposit_type`
- `agent`
- `company`
- `days_in_waiting_list`

### üü® 2. Market Segment Table
- `market_segment`
- `discount`

### üü• 3. Meal Cost Table
- `meal` ‚Äì meal type (e.g., BB, HB, FB)
- `meal_cost` ‚Äì cost of that meal per booking

> These tables were joined using common fields such as `meal` and `market_segment` to calculate total revenue, identify trends in customer behavior, and measure the impact of discounts and meal types on hotel profit.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### üìÇ Code Files (SQL Scripts)
Each SQL file corresponds to one business question and performs the required data analysis:

- `adults, children, and babies.sql`: Calculates the annual count of adults, children, and babies in bookings.
- `Individual, family bookings.sql`: Calculates the annual ratio of individual bookings (adults only) vs. family bookings (with children or babies).
- `Key Factors.sql`: Identifies the key factors (e.g., hotel type, market segment, meals, nights booked) that influence hotel revenue annually.
- `Matching Rooms.sql`: Calculates the annual percentage of cases where reserved room matches the assigned room.
- `Meals , Market Segments.sql`: Determines which meals and market segments contribute most to annual revenue.
- `Profits.sql`: Calculates the monthly profit percentage across all years.
- `public holidays and regular days.sql`: Compares revenue between public holidays and regular days annually.
- `Repeated Guests.sql`: Calculates the annual percentage of repeated vs. non-repeated guests.
- `Reservation Status.sql`: Calculates the annual percentage of bookings by reservation status.
- `room types.sql`: Analyzes yearly trends in customer room type preferences and their impact on revenue.

### üìÅ Result Files (Output CSVs)
Each CSV file contains the output corresponding to its related SQL query:

- `adults, children, and babies.csv`: Output of `adults, children, and babies.sql`.
- `Individual, family bookings.csv`: Output of `Individual, family bookings.sql`.
- `Matching Rooms.csv`: Output of `Matching Rooms.sql`.
- `Reservation Status.csv`: Output of `Reservation Status.sql`.
- `Repeated Guests.csv`: Output of `Repeated Guests.sql`.
- `Profits.csv`: Output of `Profits.sql`.
- `public holidays and regular days.csv`: Output of `public holidays and regular days.sql`.
- `room types.csv`: Output of `room types.sql`.
- `Market Segments.csv`: Output of `Meals , Market Segments.sql`.
- `Meals.csv`: Output of `Meals , Market Segments.sql` (same analysis split by dimension).
- `Hotel Type.csv`: Output of `Key Factors.sql` (filtered for hotel type).
- `Market Segment.csv`: Output of `Key Factors.sql` (filtered for market segment).
- `Meal Offered.csv`: Output of `Key Factors.sql` (filtered for meal offered).
- `Number Of Nights.csv`: Output of `Key Factors.sql` (filtered for number of nights booked).
